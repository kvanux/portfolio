                For the initial research of the project, I took it to the field
                to conduct screening survey targeting regular cafe shop goers,
                hoping to gain some insights into their general thoughts on
                customer-loyalty apps and getting volunteers for further users
                interview to identify what they like and don't about the apps
                they've tried.

                As previously stated, survey data showed that almost all
                customers and regulars have tried out customer-loyalty apps
                offered from their favorite vendors/brands before but very
                quickly grew out of it with an alarming drop-off rates of over
                70%.

                Fortunately, I was able to get to sit down with 5 participants

                the customer-loyalty apps they've tried before.

                The main goal of the study is to see first hand how well our

                improved before moving on to the final design state.

                As expected, the first round of user testing provided tons of
                interesting feedbacks, most of which were positive, along with
                some room for improvement pointed out by the participants. So I
                took some time to organize user feedbacks into clear datas,
                reassess and finalize them into actionable insights.
                <br />

                Here are our shortlisted <strong>findings</strong>:
                <br />
                - Users need the
                <strong>redeemable items to visually stand out more</strong>.
                <br />
                - <strong>Having titles alongside the icons</strong> can help
                users navigate more easily.
                <br />
                - <strong>Pushing the redeemable items upperward</strong> can
                save users a lot of time.
                <br />
                - Users want to be able to
                <strong>see how much points</strong> they are having
                <strong>while browsing rewards</strong>.

                With the new and simplified design, the app positively sparked
                interests in our users. One of the quotes I’ve taken from the

                feels so fantastic! I am really looking forward to when the app
