            - The unawareness of negative self-talk leads to negative thinking
            and in turn affects one’s confidence, work efficiency and overall
            day-to-day life. This is a common problem among people that suffer
            from depression and/or anxiety.

                Taking on the research for this project proved to be more
                difficult than it usually is as we were addressing sensitive and
                personal psychological issues.
                <br />
                I started off slow with secondary researches to identify all the
                aspects of the problem we are facing, to narrow down our target
                users and to know exactly the right questions to ask the users.
                Then I conducted an online anonymous survey to get an overview
                of participant's psychological situation, their take on the
                subject and also trying to recruit potential participants for
                user testing.

                Due to the limitations of the prototyping tool/software, I was
                not able to fully implement all the core functions of the
                product into the low-fi prototype. This prevents me from
                conducting a proper usability study as I normally would at this
                stage of the design process.
                <br />
                However, I did come out with an alternative solution that is
                basically a combination of a moderated usability study and an
                interview. Participants are asked to check out and perform basic
                navigations of the prototype and then answer a scripted
                questionaire stating what they like and don't about the designs.

                The outcomes obviously couldn't be as sufficient as they would
                be if it had been done with a fully functioning prototype.
                Fortunately, the participants still gave a lot of feedbacks that
                could be turned into actionable insights. Some of them were so
                obvious I wished I could have think of it earlier. Here are the

                Throughout the process of designing Self-talk from start to
                finish, I’ve learned that different target audiences with
                different problems might require variations in design thinking
                and methods. The challenges from this project allowed me to
                explore new research and ideation methods as well as testing
                usability with a functionality-limited prototype.
